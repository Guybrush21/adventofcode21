# My not too serious AdventOfCode 2021

Just trying to learn some Rust with the help of Advent of Code 2021 edition.

## Running solution

There is only one crate, intially there were many, one for every day. This way I need to find a good way to keep source code organize.

cargo run will log in console the solution for every days.

## Test

cargo test
will launch some unit\integrated test. All of them are using the example provide in the Advent Of Code instructions.
